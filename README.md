# EDAgame
In our university we participated in a contest where all the students of the course had to battle with AI's made for a game that the teachers developed.
This is my AI that ended up in top 10 (not winning but not bad).

It uses A* and a neural network trained with a genetic algorithm, its totally overkill and not smart at all to use a neural net for this. It was my first time implementing something like this ( I had no idea at all of how neural nets are normally implemented, but i knew that matrix multiplication was a good way to go, and it made sense), also it was my first time using search algorithms like dijkstra or A*. I consumed a lot of time in building this, but it was a really fun project. 

The code doesn't work by itself but I think its interesting even without the board and game code.

There are also the training files and another AI that doesn't use neural nets but got me pretty far anyway.
